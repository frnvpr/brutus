an experiment in governance

------------------------

This seems so cool - I like the structure of it while still also allowing everyone a chance, if they're engaged and interested, to move up and down through levels of responsibility. It's a great experiment for reputation and credibility building while also ensuring leadership doesn't get stale lol

I would also vote for the trimester epoch period though because if there are changes in Council in shorter time periods than that then you're just ending up with more upheaval than thought-out action. 

I wonder if there's a possibility for governance tokens to be used here or if that would over-complicate matters? I am by no means an expert on token use but I understand it's becoming more popular to consider.

Like the ideas here, it seems interesting. My main concern would be with "People can move down from the Successors tier to the Citizens tier by paying 1N if they don’t
wish to be electable to the council." Typically I would assume dropping down would be free and maybe the proticol could actually take some of someones BOND if they wish to drop down. So if it is 1N to go up a level, if they choose to drop back down, maybe they lose the entire 1N if it is soon, but maybe if their wait 3/6 epochs they would only lose .5 NEAR and keep the other .5 and if they wait the entire 6/6 epochs they can leave with 1N -fees (so pretty much break even)
this way the incentive is to stay in the game and if people leave early the DAO just makes funds that way

can be implemented with sputnikV2 and unless you're planning on learning Rust (or you already know it) you'll probably have to hire a dev to help you yeah.

yeah, my main point was that if it costs 1N to drop out, the incentive is to just not pay and leave the community
I didn't see any mention of how that scenario would be handled in the doc, but that is what I would do... no way I would pay to stop using something.

Very interesting! I think it’s a cool idea, but I’d suggest a few tweaks. Might be a vulnerability if Brutus kicks people without approval by the council members. How does Brutus actually select good successors? I wouldn’t necessarily trust any citizen who pays 1 NEAR.

What if Brutus only submitted a proposal to add / remove members on a regular basis?
