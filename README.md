an experiment in governance

------------------------
feedback by @mecsbecs

This seems so cool - I like the structure of it while still also allowing everyone a chance, if they're engaged and interested, to move up and down through levels of responsibility. It's a great experiment for reputation and credibility building while also ensuring leadership doesn't get stale lol

I would also vote for the trimester epoch period though because if there are changes in Council in shorter time periods than that then you're just ending up with more upheaval than thought-out action. 

I wonder if there's a possibility for governance tokens to be used here or if that would over-complicate matters? I am by no means an expert on token use but I understand it's becoming more popular to consider.
